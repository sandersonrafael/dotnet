The project's configuration is in the appsettings.json file
To use that configuration in the project, the user can use the interface IConfiguration

It is also possible for the user to create a custom appsettings.json for, for example, development, such as:
-> appsettings.Development.json
or
-> appsettings.Staging.json

The compiler take the appsettings.Development as a priority

In the terminal will be showed the Hosting environment when application starts

To change the environment, the user can change in file launchSettings.json in folder Properties

Just rename the value of "environmentVariables": { "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development" } to required environment

Now, the application will use the values from Development settings. If the setting don't exists in Development, will be found
    from appsettings.json (if exists there)

In application, it's possible to use the environment type to place a condition, like: if (app.Environment.IsStaging()) ...

The different profiles can be initialized from command line with her name. Ex: dotnet run (profileName) -> dotnet run IISExpress
